I started my first computer at 10 and I never stopped researching and learning each single day from then. Iâ€™m a technology enthusiast, not meaning only the IT ones but every product of the mind that extends human abilities to solve a problem. I love solve problems, I can safely say that is what I'm doing since I started to work, and perhaps before.In the last few years I investigated the effectiveness of team management and the extraordinary results that a well motivated and focused team can reach. As a matter of fact, I learned every day how to effectively manage resources, how to resolve issues to build great teams and keep it running at the best.
