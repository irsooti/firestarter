I'm Soumaya Erradi and I'm a software developer and an IT teacher.
I'm high skilled in web development (frontend and backend), specialized in developing enterprise applications using Angular.
Currently, I'm working as frontend lead developer in a team focused on blockchain app development.
I'm also holding coding courses and meetups to deepen technical and business issues related to Blockchain and Smart Contracts.
As a speaker at conferences I bring advanced Angular topics, tips for the integration of smart contracts and best solutions for decentralized applications and web3.
