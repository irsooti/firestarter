Hi, my name is Jai, I am a software engineer and active member of various technical communities varying from Women Techmakers, open source enablement and visibility, GDG and GDE.
I work mainly on GCP application and infrastructure modernisation projects for all types of organisations. I have been working in financial services for the last 3 years as an SRE/Architect enabling clients to move existing and deploy new workloads into the Cloud.
