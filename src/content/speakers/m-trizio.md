Engineer & Digital entrepreneur. I took the master degree in computer engineering with a thesis on AI at Polytechnic University of Bari in 2007. I worked for several years in ICT companies in Italy as a backend software developer. I attended the Mind The Bridge startup school in San Francisco in 2011. Back in Italy I started working on my own companies. Now, I'm the CTO of Wideverse, a spin-off of the Polytechnic University of Bari that works on XR technologies. In addition I'm the founder and the current lead of Google Developer Group Bari community and Content manager for Codemotion Italian conferences. Iâ€™m a public speaker globetrotter nerd with the passion for photography, SUP, running and Rock. BBQ and IPA beers addicted.
