In this talk we will explore how mobile developers can use augmented reality technologies for smartphones and tablets to turn the world into an infinite canvas for expressing their creativity. We'll show how to use libraries like Google's ARCore to create amazing immersive and interactive experiences. Did you get excited seeing the Gorillaz augmented reality concert in Time square? We will discover how to create similar experiences, using the Geospatial API, the latest feature added to the Google framework for positioning virtual elements in outdoor real spaces. We will see into the code needed to develop applications using ARCore and show real use cases to illustrate how augmented reality is already changing the way we interact with the world and how it can be used to improve people's lives.
